# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python

# In[5]:


(3*4)+5


# This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers

# In[13]:


minutes = 200
Hours = minutes / 60
print(f"{minutes} minutes is equal to {Hours} hours")


# _This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60_
